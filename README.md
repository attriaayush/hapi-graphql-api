# Building a powerful graphql API using HapiJS
Building a simple but modern and also high-performing API, using 
* [HapiJS](https://hapijs.com/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

Note: Please follow the links if you are not familiar with any of the tools mentioned above.

## Getting Started
This project uses two important libraries that are necessary in order to implement GraphQL with HapiJS <br>
```yarn add graphql apollo-server-hapi```

[graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql): It is the main package that this tool  requires.

[apollo-server-hapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-hapi): Provides integration between the Hapi server and GraphQL.

Note: GraphQL is a strictly typed language which means we have to declare the types for the fields we are using, click here for more information on [types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)

## Usage
* ```yarn install```
* ```npm start```
* And just click [here](http://localhost:4000/documentation)
